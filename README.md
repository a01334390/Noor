# Noor
Fernando Martin's personal portfolio.

## Rationale
I wanted to build something special for my first portfolio website. This is why I wanted it to be able to:
* Show my personal information
* Share information about my past projects
* Share information about my present projects
* Allow people to contact me easily
* Act as a place to upload and test files and projects
* etc.

## Technical Requirements
To do this, I'm using several different technologies to bring it to life
### Backend
For the back-end, Noor is being built using:
* Node.js 
* Express
* Gulp
* AWS SDK
* Hyperledger Composer
* Handlebars
* PM2

### Frontend
* Ionic
* SASS
* Skeleton
* Mocha
* Passport.js
* Socket.io

# Why am I sharing this?
(This is gonna be so meta) I want my portfolio website to be part of my portfolio website! Therefore, I'm sharing my progress with everyone who's interested.
