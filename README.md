<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](http://martntn.com)

This portfolio was built to showcase my most recent school projects, work projects, and passion projects to the people who were interested in checking them out. This portfolio, in its final version, should allow me to:

* Show the projects I've worked on, its development process, and some screenshots.
* Use it as a living, dynamic curriculum to apply to multiple companies.
* Allow me to experiment with new technologies.

At this moment, this website is really simple (I had to build it in 3 days), but it's scheduled to include by July 2019:
* Federated Login (Facbook)
* DynamoDB connection using AppSync
* A real dynamic interface
* AWS SES to keep in touch with my clients
* And more...

### Built With
This application was built using the following frameworks:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
